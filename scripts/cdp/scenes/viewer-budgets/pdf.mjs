/**
 * The PDF viewer's cases. In six runs of each on an M5 under a load average of 15 to 50 on 2026-10-02, the card
 * showed page 1 in 0.4 to 2.5 s, most of it the preview frame starting and loading pdf.js and its worker as the
 * demo's development server serves them, and the focus view showed its first screen in 0.1 to 0.3 s and every
 * later screen within 0.18 s. The renderers grew by 0.43 to 0.6 GB at the peak, the preview frame's process holding
 * 0.2 to 0.3 GB of it with a document open, and the GPU process by 0.09 to 0.15 GB. The main thread was held for
 * 0.03 to 0.14 s, and up to 0.42 s in the runs under the heaviest load. In three runs on the macOS runner of GitHub
 * Actions on 2026-10-02 and 03, the renderers grew by 0.52 to 0.7 GB at the peak and still held 0.34 to 0.41 GB at
 * the end, with the card's document open, and the GPU process grew by 0.12 to 0.19 GB.
 *
 * Every page in view has to be drawn. The viewer gives a canvas only to the pages within a screen of the view, and
 * the rest are blank boxes of their size, so a screen can show a drawn page beside one still blank, which the
 * default check takes for shown because it finds a drawn canvas somewhere in view. A page is drawn once its canvas
 * holds pdf.js's bitmap, which is opaque paper; a canvas still waiting for it is transparent.
