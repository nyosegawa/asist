/**
 * The Excel viewer reads only the sheet it shows, in the preview iframe, and the focus view draws only the rows
 * within a screen of its grid, which scrolls on its own. The default check would take the sticky header row for
 * content and pass a screen whose rows have not arrived yet, so this one asks for every row of the table in view
 * to have arrived, and for one of them to show text.
 *
 * In three runs on an M5 under a load average of 42 to 43 on 2026-10-02, both workbooks showed their first rows in
 * the card in 265 to 538 ms and in the focus view in 60 to 101 ms, held the page for at most 24 ms in the card and
 * 48 to 214 ms in the focus view, took at most 65 ms for a screen, and grew the renderers by 213 to 243 MB at the
 * peak and 46 to 159 MB at the end, of which the preview iframe's own process is about 140 MB. The longest blocks
 * of the focus view ran no script and laid nothing out, which is the page waiting for the processor. On GitHub's
 * macOS runner the same day, the renderers grew by 409 to 412 MB at the peak and 172 to 289 MB at the end. On the
 * M5, the viewer that parsed the whole workbook on the page grew them by 540 MB on 50,000 rows and by 896 MB on the
 * five sheets.
