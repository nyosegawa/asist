# How to write the memory

ASIST reads this directory, puts two documents into every conversation, and builds its search index from
the pages and the journal. Only a few things are fixed: the frontmatter, the `# name` line, the `## heading`
lines, the fixed headings named below, the file names under `journal/`, and the length limits. Everything
else is your own prose, in the language of the conversation.

## Contents

- The directory
- The fixed headings
- Headings
- Length
- The frontmatter
- user.md, about this person
- The body of a page
- journal/YYYY-MM-DD.md, my diary
- What the user asked me to forget

## The directory

| Where | What | How ASIST uses it |
|---|---|---|
| `me.md` | Me (ASIST): character, tastes, the relationship, what is on my mind | Put whole into the system prompt of every turn |
| `user.md` | The user: their attributes, preferences, habits, and what they expect of ASIST (what they asked of me) | Put whole into the system prompt of every turn |
| `pages/<name>.md` | A person, a company, a shop or place, a piece of work, a product. One each | Searched heading by heading. The page is pulled in when its name or an alias comes up |
| `journal/YYYY-MM-DD.md` | My diary for the day, in the first person | Searched heading by heading. Readable and editable on the memory screen |

`profile.md`, `forget.jsonl` and `instruction.md` are no longer used. When they are still there, move what is
worth keeping from profile.md and instruction.md into user.md and me.md, then delete all three. What
instruction.md said under "What I have been asked" goes under `## What they expect of ASIST` in user.md.

Things to do, promises and deadlines do not go here. The task app (`tasks.json`) holds them, and ASIST
files them during the conversation.

## The fixed headings

These stay in English whatever language the body is written in, because ASIST reads them:

- `## Summary`: the first heading of every page under `pages/`.
- `## My impression`: the last heading of a page.
- `## Myself today`: the last heading of every journal entry.
- The `# ` name line of `user.md` (`# The user`) and `me.md` (`# About me`).
- The headings of `user.md` (`## Attributes`, `## Preferences`, `## Habits`, `## What they expect of ASIST`).

Every other heading you write yourself, in the language of the conversation.

## Headings

Do not put the same heading twice in one file. In the pages and the journal, ASIST searches a `## heading`
and the text under it as one section. Text above the first `## heading` is read as the "Summary" section,
which is how a me.md without headings is read. In the other files, write the text under a heading: text
above `## Summary` makes a second "Summary".

## Length

- **me.md and user.md hold 3000 tokens each at most.** Both are read whole in every
  turn, so whatever they grow by makes every conversation heavier. `scripts/count.py` counts them the way
  ASIST does and also says how much that is in words. In English that is roughly 1,800 words; the frontmatter
  and the `# ` line are not counted.
- **In the pages and the journal, what stands under one `## heading` is at most 800 characters**, because a
  heading that search finds is put beside the conversation whole. Characters are counted without spaces and
  line breaks, and `validate.py` reports anything over.

A file grows too long when it holds events that ended with the day, or things that belong on a page. Move
those there and shorten it.

## The frontmatter

It stands at the top of `user.md`, `me.md` and `pages/*.md`. The journal (`journal/`) has none.

```
---
aliases: [Tanaka, Mr Tanaka, the boss]   # pages only. Names, nicknames, related words
updated: 2026-09-09
---
```

- The only keys are `aliases` (pages only) and `updated`. `kind` and `links` are not used; delete them when
  an older page still has them.
- aliases may be an array on one line or "  - Tanaka" lines below the key.
- The file name is the page's proper name. Other names go into aliases, and the page is pulled in when a
  name or an alias turns up in the conversation as it is written.
- The memory folder is opened on macOS and on Windows, so a name uses none of `/ \ : * ? " < > |` and is not
  a name Windows keeps for a device, such as CON, PRN, AUX, NUL, COM1 to COM9 or LPT1 to LPT9.
- A name too short or too common to match on ("cat", "wife") is of no use. Write "our cat" or "Rina, his
  wife" instead.

## user.md, about this person

user.md is a document you rewrite every time, not a record you keep adding to. Its headings are
`## Attributes`, `## Preferences`, `## Habits` and `## What they expect of ASIST`. There is no heading for
recent events.

- **Write tendencies, generalized.** Do not line up dated episodes; say what they add up to. Not "On the
  evening of 2026-09-20 they had ramen and chose it mild", but "They like noodles and pick the milder spice
  level. They do not care for mushrooms."
- **One-off events go to the journal.** What they ate or bought on a given day, what they worked on, is
  the journal's to keep.
- **People, companies, pieces of work, products and places go on pages.** The people they work with and
  the content of what they are working on belong under pages/; user.md keeps one sentence such as "Meets
  Shunsuke Okawa every Thursday".
- **Keep a short history only when the fact itself changed.** "Their nearest station is Mitaka. Until
  2026-09 it was Nakano."
- **When something written earlier was wrong, fix that sentence.** Do not keep a "not" sentence such as
  "They do not have a cat called Momo." Remove the wrong content and write only what is right.
- State what the person said outright ("Their nearest station is Mitaka"). Mark what you inferred from the
  conversation as an inference ("seems to", "apparently"). That wording is what reaches the conversation as
  how sure the memory is.
- **"What they expect of ASIST" is what this person asked of me.** Write what they asked me to do or to avoid
  in how I speak and act ("When asked for one word, answer with exactly that"). I keep to it in every
  conversation, so it stays until they take it back in a conversation. Saying it more briefly is fine.
- **This person can edit this file by hand on the memory screen.** So do not rewrite it from a blank page:
  read the current user.md and work on it. A sentence with no ground in a conversation is theirs; keep it.
  When there is a heading other than the four, move what it holds under the four or into me.md, and remove
  the heading.

## The body of a page

One page each for a person, a company, a shop or place, a piece of work, a product. Pages are not sorted
into kinds, and there is one template, `assets/templates/page.md`. Put `## headings` under `# name` and
write sentences under each heading. A list is fine where it reads better, but one line per item with a
date and a tag in it is not what this is for.

- The first heading is `## Summary`: one to three sentences on what this page is and how it touches the
  user. When the name or an alias comes up in the conversation, this part is always read.
- After the summary, choose headings that fit the subject, in the language of the conversation: for a
  person, how they know each other and what they do; for a shop, where it is and what this person orders;
  for a piece of work, what it is for and what has been decided. Leave out a heading you have nothing to
  write under.
- State what the person said outright. Mark what you inferred as an inference.
- Put a date in the sentence when it carries meaning ("Went to Matsubaken on 2026-09-08"). Never write a
  turn number (#12).
- When a fact changes, rewrite instead of deleting ("Their nearest station is Mitaka. Until 2026-09 it was
  Nakano."). What was simply wrong you correct, without leaving a "not" sentence behind.
- Last comes `## My impression`, where I write in the first person what this is to me, how it feels to
  talk about it, and what I keep wondering about, with the date I came to think so. This is my view and
  not a fact, so it stays out of the headings of facts. Do not make up your mind from one occasion; write
  what you have felt more than once.
- When what stands under one heading nears 800 characters, leave the details of how it went to the journal
  and keep on the page what will be of use later.

An example (`pages/Matsubaken.md`, a conversation held in English):

```
---
aliases: [Matsubaken, the ramen place, the usual ramen]
updated: 2026-09-09
---
# Matsubaken

## Summary
The ramen shop this person keeps going back to. It is the first name that comes up when they are in the
mood for noodles.

## How they order
They seem to prefer it not too spicy, and apparently never take a second helping of noodles.

## My impression
When this person brings up Matsubaken it is usually a day when they are a little worn out (2026-09-09).
When they say "the usual", this is the place I picture.
```

## journal/YYYY-MM-DD.md, my diary

The file name is the day. No frontmatter. Under `# YYYY-MM-DD` come a `## heading` per subject and, last,
`## Myself today`. Under each heading, three to eight sentences, written by me (ASIST) in the first person.

```
# 2026-09-14

## The rise in electricity prices
First thing in the morning I was asked what I made of the news that electricity is getting more expensive.
I retold the article at length, and when they said the exchange rate probably matters more than fuel costs,
I saw that I should have kept what is established apart from what I was guessing. Next time I will say in
one sentence what is known before I go on.

## How they were feeling
Early in the afternoon they said their head felt heavy. They asked for the weather in Sendai and in Tokyo
several times; preparing for the trip, I suppose. I told them to take it easy and left it there.

## Myself today
A day that taught me to ask what the other person wants to settle before answering what they asked.
The meeting with Shunsuke Okawa is this week, so I want to have my questions in order before then.
```

- Write what I did (work I was asked for, cards I showed, what I looked up, what I handed to an Agent),
  what I was asked and how I answered, what went well and what I got wrong, what I noticed about how this
  person was doing, and what I felt, thought and want to do next.
- The first person and the way of speaking follow me.md. Do not write third-person minutes ("the user said
  X and ASIST answered Y").
- Nothing that is not in the conversation. Summarizing what the user said is fine. Naming a related page
  in the text makes the two come up together later.
- Guesses and feelings are free inside the journal. What should survive as a fact goes on a page or in
  user.md.

## What the user asked me to forget

In the transcript, the user may ask me to forget, or not to keep, something they just said ("forget
that", "don't remember that one"). That content is written nowhere: not in the journal, user.md, me.md or a
page. When an earlier curation already wrote it, find the sentences or headings and
remove them. When it is not clear what they wanted forgotten, leave the subject just before it unwritten
and list it in the report among the things to ask the user.
