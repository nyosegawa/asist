"""Checks a memory folder. Usage: <skill>/uv run --no-project <skill>/scripts/validate.py <memoryDir>

Every problem is printed on its own line and the exit code is 1; with none it prints OK. The rules come from
memory_format.py, two folders up, which ASIST applies as well when it merges a curation. The Japanese skill
ships the same check with its problems written in Japanese.
