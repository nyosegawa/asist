"""Counts what each file that goes into every conversation costs there, against its limit.
Usage: <skill>/uv run --no-project <skill>/scripts/count.py <memoryDir>

Prints one line per file and the exit code is 1 when a file is over its limit. The count is the one ASIST
makes before it merges a curation and when the user saves on the memory screen. The Japanese skill ships the
same script with its lines written in Japanese.
