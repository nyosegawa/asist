Under "Conversation", choose the conversation model and the model for the bridge phrase. The bridge phrase is a short phrase that ASIST prepares while you are still talking and says before the main answer.

Save an API key for each provider under "API keys" in "Integrations". Before saving a key, ASIST checks that it can get the list of models from that provider's API. You can't choose a model from a provider that has no key. Keys are stored encrypted with a key from the macOS keychain.

Next to the model, you can choose the depth of thinking. The default is the shallowest setting, so that a voice conversation doesn't keep you waiting. With a deeper setting, it can take more than ten seconds before the answer starts.

Web search uses the provider's built-in search, so it isn't available with Cerebras models, which have no built-in search. The conversation history is stored in a form that doesn't depend on the provider, so the conversation carries on even if you switch models partway through.

The list of models you can choose is in [Models ASIST uses](/en/docs/reference/models/).
