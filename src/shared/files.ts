 * Explorer. Audio still plays, since <audio> reads it by ranges, and only its waveform, which decodes the whole file,
 * is left out. The kinds not listed travel as text up to MAX_TEXT_BYTES, or are loaded by the page's own image,
 * media and frame elements. A notebook travels as text too, but its viewer parses the whole of it as JSON, which no
 * beginning of it is, so its limit is MAX_TEXT_BYTES.
 *
 * Measured on 2026-10-02 in the demo under headless Chrome on an Apple M5 with 32 GB, opening generated files in a card
 * and in the focus view, the slower of the two given. Most limits sit where the costliest likely file of the kind took
 * about a second to show and grew the page by less than a gigabyte, so that a machine two or three times slower still
 * shows it within a few seconds. docx and audio are set higher, for the files they most often are.
 * - xlsx, 8 MB: sales records took 1.2 s for 9.3 MB and 4.9 s for 37 MB, and a grid of small numbers 1.1 s for 5.8 MB
 *   and 2.0 s for 11.6 MB, all of it holding the page's thread.
 * - docx, 16 MB: a Word file this large is most often one with a few photos, which cost 0.03 s per MB. Prose costs ten
 *   times as much for its size (5.5 MB took 1.8 s, holding the thread, and grew the page by 1.1 GB), but a file of
 *   that much prose is rare.
 * - pdf, 256 MB: scanned pages took 0.7 s for 281 MB and grew the page by 0.6 GB, and 1.7 s for 1.1 GB by 2.3 GB.
 *   Little of it holds the thread, so the memory sets the limit.
 * - audio, 8 MB: an ordinary song keeps its waveform. 9.2 MB of 128 kbps stereo (10 minutes) grew the page by 0.68 GB
 *   while it decoded off the thread; speech at 32 kbps mono costs twice as much for its size, 9.2 MB (40 minutes)
