/**
 * Prefetched injection. At the start of a turn the confirmed transcription searches memory, and the
 * units it hits become a note on the user's utterance. The note stays on the user record, in `notes`
 * and `memoryIds`, and is appended after the text in the history as well, so that what the model read
 * and what the history holds agree.
 *
 * A unit whose body the memory block, instruction.md, already holds is skipped, and so is a unit
 * already shown in the recent history that is sent unsummarized, whether it appeared in an earlier
 * note or in the result of recall.
 *
 * The note starts with the memory marker and then lists the hit units grouped by page, as markdown,
 * without collapsing the bodies:
 *   # page name       a heading unit is "## heading" followed by the body, exactly as in the file
 *   # journal of a    the heading and the body of the journal ASIST wrote in the first person that
 *   day              day; journals have a budget of their own, separate from headings
 * How certain something is comes across in the wording of the body: what the user said is stated
 * plainly, an inference is hedged. The format and how to treat it are explained in the stable layer of
 * the system prompt, in prompt.ts's memory section, and are not repeated every turn.
