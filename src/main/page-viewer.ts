/**
 * The session the HTML page of the files card is shown in, which reaches no network. The page is a <webview>
 * of the app's page, and every <webview> is attached in this session whatever its tag asks for, so a document
 * from an allowed folder is never rendered in the app's own session. The policy the document is served with
 * (documentPolicy) refuses every remote source; the session closes what a policy does not reach, each measured
 * in Electron 43.7.7 on 2026-10-02:
 *
 * - A `<link rel="dns-prefetch">` makes the network service look its host up without any request, which
 *   X-DNS-Prefetch-Control, a proxy, webRequest, the session's preconnect event and network emulation all left
 *   in place. Only turning DNS prefetching off in the page's renderer stopped it.
 * - WebRTC is not governed by the policy. Over UDP it reached any address the page named; over TCP it goes
 *   through the session's proxy, which leads nowhere.
 * - A navigation, prefetch or resource the policy misses is a request, which webRequest cancels.
 *
 * WebRTC still has the network service resolve a host name the page writes as an ICE server or a remote
 * candidate, which neither the proxy nor webRequest reaches: a name under .local is asked for by multicast DNS
 * on the local network, and any other name by the system resolver (getaddrinfo in the network service). Nothing
 * connects to the host. Nothing in Electron stops the lookup for one session or one renderer: Chromium 150
 * ignores a `webrtc` directive in the policy as unrecognised, turning off every WebRTC runtime feature of Blink
 * leaves RTCPeerConnection in place, and WebRTC asks for no permission.
