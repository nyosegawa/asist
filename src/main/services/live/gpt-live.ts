/**
 * GPT-Live-1. A full-duplex voice model listens and speaks, while decisions and tools are handed to brain
 * (runTurn) through client delegation.
 *
 * The flow: microphone audio streams in, GPT-Live says its backchannel and sends
 * session.delegation.created, the input transcript just before it becomes the user utterance of a new
 * brain turn, brain's sentences go back through session.commentary.append, and GPT-Live reads them in its
 * own voice. The delegation event carries no text of the utterance, so the transcript is picked up only
 * after it settles. Typed input goes straight to brain, and its reply is read as commentary with no
 * delegation id.
 *
 * The engine writes nothing to the conversation log, and the output transcript is not used at all. Brain
 * records the utterances it is handed and its own replies, and the screen shows brain's text. What the
 * voice says besides is content-free by its instructions, and nothing marks where its reading of one
 * reply ends and the next begins, so its transcript could not be put under the right turn. The input
 * transcript is shown on screen while the user speaks, one line per utterance, and every utterance
 * reaches brain: the one a delegation takes, together with those before it that no delegation took.
 *
 * A session is append-only and starts blank when it is reopened, so the recent history is handed over as
 * the initial context every time it opens.
