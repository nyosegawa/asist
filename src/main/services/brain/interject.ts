 * Speaks a prepared sentence without going through the LLM. It goes to the session's speech route:
 * TTS in the classic setup, the voice side in GPT-Live. On an engine where the model itself decides
 * what to say (Gemini Live) the model reads the sentence and records it from its own output
 * transcript. Nothing starts while a user turn is in progress. The sentence reaches the screen as the
 * text of its turn, as a reply does, and is written to the conversation log as an assistant utterance.
