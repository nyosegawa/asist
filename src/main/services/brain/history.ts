/**
 * Builds the history sent to the API out of the conversation log. Records are applied in order to a
 * list of turns, from which both the messages for the API and the summary of the older part are
 * produced. At startup the latest checkpoint, which holds the whole compacted history, is the base and
 * only the records after it are replayed.
 *
 * The history is a single thread. The messages sent to the API during a turn, the assistant responses
 * and the user messages carrying tool results, are kept as message records and sent again in the same
 * shape on the next turn. Because nothing but the end changes, the prefix stays stable and the prompt
 * cache keeps working, and ids or paths a tool returned can still be referred to in later turns.
 *
 * Turns run one after another, so only the newest turn that has an input, an utterance or a notice,
 * can still be in progress, and the records that follow an input belong to it. A turn before it that
 * never got a reply will never get one: a voice model records what it said under an exchange of its
 * own, and a turn cut off by quitting or a crash is not resumed.
 *
 * Compaction is decided in tokens. The context length is the server's usage plus an estimate of what
 * was added since. Above compressAtTokens it runs when the conversation goes quiet; above limitTokens
 * it starts before the turn without being waited for; above hardLimitTokens, which is close to the API
 * window, a turn is not sent at all until it has finished, which guards against replaying a long log
 * with no checkpoint.
 *
 * A compaction keeps the most recent recentTurns turns raw and folds the turns before them, up to the
 * turn in progress, into one handover summary that replaces them. The summary is written from the
 * user and assistant text plus one line per tool with its name and input, because paths and ids
 * appear only in the input; tool results are not passed to it. If the turns kept raw alone exceed half the limit, fewer are
 * kept. Turns added while the summary is being written stay. The summary is rewritten from scratch
 * each time, so it does not grow with every compaction. The compacted history is written to the log as
 * a checkpoint, and a failed summary leaves the history untouched: a crash during the summary call
 * changes nothing, and after a restart the last checkpoint and the records after it rebuild the same
 * state and the attempt is repeated at the next quiet moment.
