 * The URL rules of the demo. The path says what is being looked at, and the query only says how to look
 * at it.
 *
 * - /                         The shell with the list of samples, opening on the conversation screen.
 * - /cards  /cards/<sample>   The shell with the card samples, either all of them or one.
 * - /screens/<screen>         The shell with the app opened on that screen and state; views.ts holds the names.
 * - /preview/cards[/<sample>] What the shell shows in its iframe. The capture scripts open it directly, and ?type= narrows it to one card type.
 * - /preview/screens/<screen> The same, for a screen.
 * - /app                      The app without the shell, driven by typing. ?say=<utterance> sends utterances in order at startup.
 * - /i18n                     Every message of the UI dictionary with its languages side by side. ?group= and ?q= narrow it.
 *
 * Prefixing a shell URL with /preview gives the URL loaded in the iframe.
