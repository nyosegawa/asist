/**
 * Opens a turn with an aizuchi and a bridging phrase. Playback starts the moment the VAD decides
 * speech has ended, and once the final transcript arrives the words already spoken are handed to
 * brain. Waiting for the final transcript would delay the aizuchi by the ASR time, measured at a
 * p50 of about 0.4 s, so the kind of aizuchi comes from the classifier's AizuchiClassification over
 * the partial transcripts instead.
 *
 * The bridge synthesizes the phrase that the BridgePlan looked ahead for, such as "会議の件ですね。",
 * and plays it after the aizuchi and before the answer. bridgeAllowed keeps it out of replies,
 * corrections, greetings and unfinished sentences. If the answer's own text got queued first, the
 * bridge does not play and the outcome is recorded in the measurements.
 *
 * An utterance is identified by startedAt, the time capture began. A speech that yields no turn,
 * because its transcription failed, meant nothing or was dropped as echo, cancels it, and an
 * utterance that finishes first has begin replace it. A bridge promises that an answer follows, so
 * one that has not started sounding is withdrawn when no answer will: the speech is cancelled, or
 * its turn ends without saying anything.
